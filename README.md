# Oxygen Git Client add-on

The **Git Client** add-on installs a Git client in *Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer*. It contributes multiple side-views, specialized for different Git operations, the main one being named **Git Staging**. The *Git Staging* side-view is available by default only in the *Editor* and *DITA* UI perspectives.

This add-on is compatible with *Oxygen XML Editor/Author/Developer* version 21.1 or higher.
