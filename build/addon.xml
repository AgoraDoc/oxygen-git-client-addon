				<body>
					<div>
						<p>After installing the plugin, if the <b>Git Staging</b> view is not visible,  you can open it from the <b>Window > Show View</b> menu.</p>
						
						<h2>Selecting the working copy</h2>
						<div><p>Click the <b>Browse</b> button to select a working copy from your file system. The selected folder
							must be a Git Repository. The plugin assumes that you already have a local clone of the remote repository.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2>Unstaged resources area</h2>
						<div>
							<p>In the unstaged resources area (the one on top) you will see all the modifications that have occurred since
								your last commit (files that have been modified, new files and deleted files). Various actions are available
								in the contextual menu (<b>Open</b>, <b>Open in compare editor</b>).</p>
							<p>You can stage all the files by clicking the <b>Stage All</b> button or you can stage some of them
								by selecting and clicking the <b>Stage Selected</b> button. You can even individually stage each file 
								by clicking the <b>Stage</b> button that appears next to each file.</p>
							<p>You can switch from the flat(table) view to a tree view
								by clicking on the button positioned above area.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2>Staged resources area</h2>
						<div>
							<p>In the staging area you will see all the resources that are ready to be committed. Any files from this area
								can be unstaged and sent back to the unstaged resources area. The staging area has similar actions with the unstaging area.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2>Comparing changes and conflict resolution</h2>
						<div>
							<p>At any time, if you want to see the differences between the
								last commit and your current modifications you can double click
								the file that appears either in the staging or unstaging area and the <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/19.0/ug-editor/topics/file-comparison-x-tools.html">Oxygen's Diff</a> window will 
								appear and highlight the changes.</p>
							<p>If the file is in conflict (has been modified both by you and another), <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/19.0/ug-editor/topics/file-comparison-x-tools.html#file-comparison__threeway_comparisons">Oxygen's Three Way Diff</a>
								will show a comparison between the local change, the remote change, and the original base revision.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2>Committing</h2>
						<div><p>After staging the files, on the bottom of the view you can input the commit message and commit them into your local repository.
							For convenience, you can also select one of the previously entered messages.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h2>Push/Pull</h2>
						<div><p>To push your local repository changes to the remote one you must click on the <b>Push</b> button from the view's toolbar.
							To bring the changes from the remote repository into your local one you must click on the <b>Pull</b> button from the same toolbar.</p></div>
